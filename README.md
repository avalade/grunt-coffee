# grunt-coffee

JavaScripts your Coffee

## Getting Started
Install this grunt plugin next to your project's [grunt.js gruntfile][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-coffee`

Then add this line to your project's `grunt.js` gruntfile:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-coffee');
```

## Documentation
You'll need to install `grunt-coffee` first:

    npm install grunt-coffee

Then modify your `grunt.js` file by adding the following line:

    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-coffee');

Then add some configuration for the plugin like so:

    grunt.initConfig({
        ...
        coffee: {
          app: {
            src: ['path/to/coffee/files/*.coffee'],
            dest: 'where/you/want/your/js/files',
            options: {
                bare: true
            }
          }
        },
        ...
    });

Then just run `grunt coffee` and enjoy!

Grunt Coffee will, by default, run coffee with the `--bare` flag set.
If you want to run it with the top level variable safety, make sure
you set your options to:

    options: {
        bare: false
    }

If you have `dest` path and want to preserve the directory structure of your coffee files, pass the `preserve_dirs` option.

    options: {
        preserve_dirs: true
    }

Also, if you just want to preserve the directory structure, starting from a base path, pass the `base_path` option.

    options: {
        preserve_dirs: true,
	base_path: 'path/to'
    }

This will create the files under `where/you/want/your/js/files/coffee/files/`.
