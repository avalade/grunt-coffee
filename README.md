## Documentation
You'll need to install `grunt-coffee` first:

    npm install grunt-coffee

Then modify your `grunt.js` file by adding the following line:

    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-coffee');

Then add some configuration for the plugin like so:

    grunt.initConfig({
        ...
        coffee: {
          app: {
            src: ['path/to/coffee/files/*.coffee'],
            dest: 'where/you/want/your/js/files',
            options: {
                bare: true
            }
          }
        },
        ...
    });

Then just run `grunt coffee` and enjoy!

Grunt Coffee will, by default, run coffee with the `--bare` flag set.
If you want to run it with the top level variable safety, make sure
you set your options to:

    options: {
        bare: false
    }

If you have `dest` path and want to preserve the directory structure of your coffee files, pass the `dirs` option".

    options: {
        dirs: true
    }
